Playtested by: Ben Tingley 12/5
Feedback:
* Mouse Sensitivity too high
* Everything felt intuitive except targeting.
* Cycling targets is clunky, a point & lock-on system could be better
* It would be cool if there was some sort of ultimate ability as well.

Feedback:

* Walked off edge of map.

Deciding Prototype:
I apparently dramatically misunderstood the assignment, and thought we decided which prototype to develop after receiving feedback on the pitches. Oops!
I at least originally picked this one because I wanted to prototype the core systems to pitch for CMPM 171.
For this turn in, I'm only making one major change which is a re-vamp of the targeting system. 
I intend in the future to add a system for ultimate abilities, but didn't want to implement that before getting feedback from my potential team members in 171.
